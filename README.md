# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results

This project has been submitted to Udacity towards the fulfillment of the Advanced Data Analysis Nanodegree. The extract below is the project description by Udacity:

<p>A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.  It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these.</p>
<p>For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.</p>
<p>The data and the Jupyter Notebook, which are all of the files you need to complete the project, are provided for you in a downloadable zip file in the resources tab (as well as under "Supporting Materials" below). Note that portions of the notebook reference back to quizzes that are linked in this lesson to ensure you are on the right track.</p>
<p>Although the quizzes in this lesson are not necessary to successfully complete the project (though they are helpful), all of the items on the <a href="https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/3307/view" target="_blank">Project Rubric</a> must meet specifications to successfully complete the project.</p>
